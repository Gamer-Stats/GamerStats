The continuous optical beam delivers zero-latency, with a 0.2ms response time versus the 30ms of mechanical. Each key is full NKRO and engineered with a calculated shallow stroke. This ensures each keypress can register simultaneously regardless of how many keys are pressed at a time, while also increasing active return rate and decreasing finger fatigue. COMPACT HYBRID DESIGN: This gaming key is designed without a ten key pad, providing a compact and ergonomic left-handed design with additional keys positioned comfortably within reach for crucial bindings and macros. The design is ideal for strenuous sessions of gaming as it helps to reduce long-term shoulder strain by allowing more neutral mouse and key positioning. This design also incorporates contact-free engineering for a premium smooth and linear key feel with less key chatter. BATTLE TESTED DURABILITY: The LK Libra is manufactured with weapons-grade anodized aluminum, providing a lightweight frame that is smudge- and fingerprint-resistant. This key has been engineered to withstand over 100 million keystrokes per switch, with a stabilizing bar that reinforces every key for tighter control and a premium, uniform key feel. With features that resist oxidation, water damage, spills, and intense gaming, you and your gear will be able to outlast the competition! WATER RESISTANT &amp; DIGITAL SENSORS: Engineered with nanocoating, a water-resistant barrier, and strategic drainage holes, this key is well designed to ensure you&rsquo;re never out of the fight when accidents happen. The optical sensors are completely digital, freeing them from mechanical failures caused by metal friction, liquid spills, oxidization, and more.

Since reference designs were promised to retail at $999, the ASUS is 30% more expensive&mdash;just for a custom design!

The board features the updates aesthetics for the ROG Strix branding, featuring black chromed VRM heat sinks as well as an intricately detailed PCIe armor plate that protects the M.2 ports and chipset as well. Its base black PCB acts as a good accent to the design with it easily fitting in to most gamer-centric builds. All of the normal nice to haves are integrated into the board, included multiple 12v and 5v RGB headers, a front panel USB 3.1 port, multiple LAN ports integrated into the rear panel, and some RGB LEDs sprinkled throughout the board&rsquo;s surface.

If you&rsquo;re a PC gamer, the RTX 3090 doesn&#39;t really make much sense. The massive 24GB VRAM buffer has no appeal here, and despite Nvidia&rsquo;s best efforts, 8K gaming just isn&rsquo;t a thing, hell even 4K is still niche.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>~By TechSpot</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>This frankly enormous graphics card is supremely powerful, but is more worthy of its Titan credentials than the GeForce branding. For your average gamer it doesn&#39;t deliver enough over the RTX 3080 to make sense, but for the pro-creator it&#39;s a workload-crushing card.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>~By PCGamer</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>The Nvidia RTX 3090 Founders Edition is a great graphics card. It doesn&rsquo;t make sense for most gamers based on the price alone, but if you&rsquo;re a video editor, 3D modeler, or are dipping your toes into 8K content, this is simply the best consumer GPU on the market today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>~By IGN</p>\r\n</blockquote>",

Use on the Apple iPad requires a suitable USB connection adaptor, such as the Apple cam Connection Kit. The body of the NT-USB features a zero-latency stereo headphone moning (3.5mm) jack, which allows you to mon the microphone input in realtime, along with dials to adjust the moning level and mix between the computer/iPad audio and the microphone input. A premium pop-filter is included, which fits onto the base of the mic, positioning the filter the ideal distance from the capsule to minimize plosives (hard &lsquo;B&rsquo;, &lsquo;T&rsquo; or &lsquo;P&rsquo; sounds that produce a harsh sound) during singing or speech. Also provided is a high-quality stand mount with industry standard 3/8&Prime; thread, desktop tripod stand that allows the NT-USB to sit at a comfortable height on a tabletop, and a pouch for storage of the microphone when not in use. compatible with both Windows and Mac computers, as well as the Apple iPad via the USB cam connection kit (available directly from Apple) Gain setting: When the gain is set too high, the microphone will be too sensitive and can pick up room noise that can even be heard as a hiss.
