But Miguel inspired El to try it out. It was here that he opted to start a YouTube Chanel. Miguel chipped in as a helper where the two chose to share their jokes on the said platform. It was in 2006 where Rubius opted to upload his first video under a moniker called Rubius. After some time he came up with his second channel titled as ElrubiusOMG in 2011.It was here that he took extra time to upload a wide array of gameplay videos especially The Elder Strolls which rose him to fame.

He is known for playing League of Legends gameplays.</p>", "body": "<h2>Tyler1 Carrer</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Before Tyler Steinkamp became the man we know him to be today, he was a Computer Science major at Central Methodist University where he was a part of the school&rsquo;s football team. In the middle of his studies at the University, Tyler suddenly dropped out of school to pursue a career in streaming games online in League of Legends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even before he started streaming, Tyler was already a well-established player who was among the top players in higher elos. He was a Draven one-trick who would play the champion in every lane he could and was among the very few players at the time to successfully execute the champion well. Tyler became famous for his antics on screen but to become a famous streamer, you had to push for more to gain more viewers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first signs of fame came in 2014 when he attracted the attention of some fans as he peaked 13th on NA&#39;s competitive ladder. At the time, he was mostly playing ADC, preferably Draven, a pick that will become a signature champion of his in the years to come. That being said, his career didn\\&#39;t take off until 2016, when he decided to withdraw from Central Methodist University and fully focus on his League of Legends career as a content creator and high ELO player.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Streaming Career</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you were an original viewer of Tyler&rsquo;s streams, you knew what kind of content you were getting into. When it comes to toxicity, Tyler1 was the very definition of what that word meant in the gaming community. He was a League of Legends streamer who would feature his gameplay primary when he was on Draven, but when he didn&rsquo;t get his champion every one on his team would suffer the consequences of not giving him what he wants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tyler1 was known to intentionally feed kills to the enemy team by running straight into the tower. He would also flame his team whenever some of them would underperform. Tyler&rsquo;s temper was his most charming factor where he would destroy your earphones by screaming into the microphone to try and get his point across. The worst part about that is people found it funny so his channel grew bigger and bigger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tyler1&#39;s initial spike in popularity came from viral short clips in which he\\&#39;d insult his teammates or intentionally lose games. He had a so-called \\&quot;int list\\&quot; at the time, which was a list of players that he would troll and intentionally lose games with if he played with them on the team. He had broad descriptions of those players he hated, the reasons why he hated them, and what he\\&#39;ll do if he encounters them in-game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Riot Games didn&rsquo;t have a strong system against cheaters and toxic players back then but they managed to punish Tyler1 in a way. Tyler would frequently get banned or suspended but since Tyler&rsquo;s content was mainly on the entertainment factor he gave while being toxic, the bans wouldn&rsquo;t faze him so he&rsquo;d simply create a new account to climb the ladder again. He did so every time Riot Games banned his accounts and it didn&rsquo;t bother him one bit. He stayed true to his identity even if his account was different each time.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Indefinite Ban From League</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that Tyler had become one of League of Legends&#39; most influential figures, Riot Games had no choice but to take action against him unless they wanted the players to know that players like him can get away with toxic behavior. For the first time in League of Legends history, Riot Games&rsquo; implemented an ID Ban. This ban was unique since it didn&rsquo;t only ban an account you owned, it banned you &ndash; as the person &ndash; from the game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whenever Tyler1 would stream a game, his account would instantly get banned. Sure, Tyler could still play the game while he wasn&rsquo;t streaming but that doesn&rsquo;t earn him money at all. No matter how many accounts he created, Riot Games would snipe him off Twitch so that he could never share his gameplay live on the game ever again. At this point, he knew that there was no way Tyler could make money off League of Legends again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From April 2016 to January 2018, Riot Games made it its mission to prevent Tyler from streaming League again. Unfortunately, Tyler1 managed to sneak in 1 or 2 games of League during his streams but would be banned immediately after. During this period, he would desperately cling to a streaming by trying out new games or showcasing a variety of streams such as cooking shows or discussions about random stuff or news.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The #FreeTyler1 Movement</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>When Tyler was permanently banned from League of Legends, it instigated a movement where his fans would ask for Riot Games to free him from his ban. During live esports events, people on the stage would lift sign cards that had the #FreeTyler1 hashtag written to show their support for their favorite streamer. There were even petitions only which supported the movement stating Riot Games should unban him from League of Legends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tyler became a martyr in the League of Legends community for all the players that have been banned before. It doesn&rsquo;t make sense that someone who intentionally behaved in a toxic manner in form of tens of thousands of viewers. Although Riot Games saw how much the community saw Tyler as someone they looked up to so they devised a plan that would provide a huge impact on the League of Legends community</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Comeback To League</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>On January 4, 2018, Riot Games lifted the ban on Tyler1 after he claimed that he underwent intensive rehab to fix his toxic behavior on stream. During his first stream after a while, Tyler broke the record of having the highest amount of viewers in a single stream with over 386,000 viewers. This became one of the most momentous events in League of Legends history as one of the most hated people in the game finally achieved his grand return.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tyler being reformed wasn&rsquo;t just something he claimed to get Riot Games&rsquo; favor, though. Players tried to test Tyler&rsquo;s patience by banning Draven on his streams or intentionally angering him but he kept his cool. The man would no longer go on aggressive sprees to display his dissatisfaction but would instead use the opportunity given to him by accepting losses with grace. Many people were disappointed with this change but even more, people started respecting Tyler and gained more viewers because of this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tyler still retained his image of being the overly masculine dude that screamed into the microphone. However, he only did this in the camera and not on the game&rsquo;s chat system. It also wasn&rsquo;t as severe or personal as it used to be and he would only get angry in acceptable cases that even normal people would get angry at. Overall, viewers and esports personalities started accepting this revamped version of the popular streamer in 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Tyler1 Championship Series</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Tyler&rsquo;s welcome back to League of Legends was so huge that Riot Games even allowed him to sponsor his tournament where he, himself, would cast the games. It was met with a lot of support that popular streamers such as Imaqtipie, Scarra, Voyboy, Nightblu3, and Shiphtur even joined in on the fun to compete against other top players from all around North America. This would mark a major change in the streaming community.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>League&#39;s Biggest Content Creator</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The period after Tyler1&#39;s urban up until today is filled with many memorable moments, such as him getting Challenger on roles he hasn\\&#39;t previously touched, or him making TCS in both 2018 and 2019, awarding dedicated players with over $100.000 total.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That being said, there is one moment that specifically stands out in this period. The summer split LCS final in September 2019, in which Tyler1 played on Riot&#39;s stage alongside ex-pro players and other big League streamers alike. The game was watched live by millions at home and thousands in person, with the VOD of the game having almost 7 million views at the time of writing. The detail that perhaps stood out the most is that Tyler laned with Phreak, his former nemesis and current Riot employee, which made the game even more iconic than it already was.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was the first time that Riot officially affiliated themselves with Tyler1, and the community was stoked to see Tyler on the big stage for the first time. It was one of the biggest moments in League of Legends history, as riot partnered up with the biggest content creator their game has to offer, despite his controversial past. Overall, it&#39;s an amazing redemption story of a random kid from Missouri that overcame his toxicity issues to become Riot&#39;s ambassador and one of the most beloved figures in the community of the world&#39;s biggest multiplayer game.</p>", "ref": "", "page_type": 1, "writer": null, "tags": [2, 16, 97]}}, {"model": "core.wiki", "pk": 5, "fields": {"title": "Dream", "slug": "dream", "avatar": 809, "created_at": "2022-04-09T12:09:46.649Z", "updated_at": "2022-05-04T08:28:13.560Z", "meta_title": "Dream", "meta_description": "<p>Dream</p>", "canonical_url": null, "index_page": true, "publish": true, "meta_images": null, "info_box": 357, "overview": "<p>Born in 1999, <a href=\"/setup/dream/\">Dream </a>grew up with an attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

He does not seem to currently have a Twitch account, so no streaming revenue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sway begun playing games competitively at a young age and has made it big with Faze Clan. His Youtube channel was created back in 2013. His first video was posted on March of 2017 which was a Call Of Duty video. The video included extended gameplay and was titled &ldquo;Easy De Atomizer&rdquo;. The video has over 200,000 views as of now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sway&rsquo;s channel has garnered over 420 million views throughout its existence. He posts frequently on his Youtube. Sway has an estimated net worth of around $5 million. His wealth mainly consists of his earnings from Youtube and a bunch of sponsorship deals. It is to be noted that he is under a contract to represent Faze Clan and is believed to be worth a good amount of money. He also has multiple paid promotions and endorsement deals on his Instagram handle, which generate decent money. His sponsors include big brands like G Fuel, Nissan, ScufGaming.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Controversies</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Sway Losing Fortnite Support-A-Creator</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Support-A-Creator code is a feature Fortnite introduced to help aid the content creators in the community with some financial help. A fraction of the money spent on V bucks goes to any creator of your choice based on the code you choose while making the transaction. However Faze Sway tweeted in July on 2021 that his creator code was permanently removed by the developers. He also posted a screenshot alongside the tweet which was from the developers indicating how he violated the terms of service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However no details are mentioned from the developers on the issue. It is believed that Epic banned Sway because of his cryptic tweets towards Fortnite dying and the lack of new content. Fortnite is known to ban people because of their toxic comments on social media accounts targeted towards the developers and the game.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Accused Of Cheating And Teaming Up</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Sway was competing in the Solo Cash Cup when he was accused of teaming up with Wistles. According to tournament guidelines provided by Epic, it is a bannable offence and against the rules to team up with other players. Sour provides video evidence which shows both of the players targeting him and then ignoring each other after his death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sour also said that there was no point in reporting Sway since he has a massive following. However, he was proved wrong as this made waves through the Fortnite community and Sway received tons of backlash while some even supported him. Sway later confirmed that he was on a phone call with his friends while competing in the tournament. He mentioned that he had no intent of sabotaging someone else&rsquo;s game or teaming up. He did agree to ignore Wistle as he was a friend, which he apologized for.</p>", "ref": "", "page_type": 1, "writer": null, "tags": [66, 67, 78]}}, {"model": "core.wiki", "pk": 10, "fields": {"title": "Adin Ross", "slug": "adin-ross", "avatar": 804, "created_at": "2022-04-09T12:12:58.839Z", "updated_at": "2022-05-04T08:16:36.218Z", "meta_title": "Adin Ross", "meta_description": "<p>Adin Ross</p>", "canonical_url": null, "index_page": true, "publish": true, "meta_images": null, "info_box": 361, "overview": "<p><a href=\"/setup/adin-ross/\">Adin Ross</a> was born and brought up in a Jewish household and spent a part of his childhood in New York City.</p>", "body": "<h2>Adin Ross Career</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Ross is known as an acquaintance of basketball legend LeBron James&rsquo; son Bronny.

He began playing professionally in 2009. He played for various organization like Cloud9, Renegades, Team Liquid and Luminosity Gaming. Blevins started playing H1Z1 and then PlayerUnknown&rsquo;s Battelgrounds. After H1Z1 , he started playing PUBG and won PUBG Gamescom Invitational Squads classification in August 2017. But his popularity increased by playing Fortnite Battle Royale in october 2017.

He played for various organizations including Cloud9, Renegades, Team Liquid, and most recently, Luminosity Gaming. Blevins became a streamer in 2011. He began playing H1Z1, then moved to PlayerUnknown&rsquo;s Battlegrounds. He joined Luminosity Gaming in 2017 first as a Halo player, then to H1Z1, later moving to PUBG, where he won the PUBG Gamescom Invitational Squads classification in August 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Blevins began streaming the newly released Fortnite Battle Royale shortly after the PUBG Gamescom Invitational. His viewership began to grow, which coincided with the game&rsquo;s growth in popularity over the late 2017/early 2018 period. His followers on Twitch had grown from 500,000 in September 2017 to over 2 million by March 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In March 2018, Blevins set the Twitch record for the largest concurrent audience on an individual stream (outside of tournament events), 635,000, while playing Fortnite with Drake, Travis Scott, and Juju Smith-Schuster. This stream inspired Epic Games, the developers behind Fortnite, to host a charitable pro-am event featuring popular streamers like Blevins paired with famous celebrities in Fortnite at E3 2018 in June of that year; Blevins paired with electronic musician Marshmello won the event. In April 2018, he broke his own viewing record during his event Ninja Vegas 2018, where he accumulated an audience of about 667,000 live viewers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Blevins partnered with Red Bull Esports in June 2018, and held a special Fortnite event, the Red Bull Rise Till Dawn in Chicago on July 21, 2018, where players could challenge him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Blevins&rsquo; rise in popularity on Twitch is considered to be synergistically tied to the success of Fortnite Battle Royale. In December 2018, Blevins estimated he had made close to US$10 million in 2018, while Epic Games reported they had earned over US$3 billion in revenue in the year, primarily due to Fortnite. To acknowledge&rsquo;s Blevins&rsquo; importance to Fortnite&rsquo;s success, Epic added a Ninja-based cosmetic skin to the game in January 2020 as the first part of an &ldquo;Icon Series&rdquo; for other real-life personalities associated with Fortnite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reuters reported that Blevins had been paid US$1 million by Electronic Arts to promote Apex Legends, a competing battle royale game to Fortnite, for playing the game on his Twitch stream and promoting the title through social media account during Apex release in February 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On August 1, 2019, Blevins left Twitch to stream exclusively on Microsoft&rsquo;s Mixer platform. His wife and manager Jessica told The Verge that the contract with Twitch had limited the ability for Ninja to grow his brand outside of video gaming, and that because of the state of Twitch&rsquo;s community, &ldquo;it really seemed like he was kind of losing himself and his love for streaming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to large number of subscribers on Twitch and Mixer, Blevins has over 23 million subscribers on YouTube as of May 2020. At the time, he was earning over $500,000 per month from streaming Fortnite and credits the game&rsquo;s free-to-play business model as a growth factor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Due to the shutdown of Mixer in July 2020, Blevins was released from his exclusivity deal, enabling him to stream on other platforms.On July 8, 2020, Blevins began streaming on YouTube.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Other appearances</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Blevins and his family were featured in several episodes of the television game show Family Feud in 2015, while he was gaining popularity as a professional video game player. According to The Brillion News, Blevins was the reason he and his team were able to make it onto the show. In an episode aired August 2019, after he had achieved his fame, his family returned as contestants on Celebrity Family Feud.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In September 2018, Blevins became the first professional esports player to be featured on the cover of ESPN The Magazine, marking a breakthrough into mainstream sports fame.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Blevins worked with the record label Astralwerks in October 2018 to compile an album titled Ninjawerks: Vol. 1 featuring original songs by electronic music acts including Alesso, Nero, Tycho, and 3LAU. Blevins, in addition to being fans of these artists, felt the album was &ldquo;another big step towards bridging the gap between music artists and gamers&rdquo;. The album was released on December 14, 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Blevins was one of several Internet celebrities featured in YouTube Rewind 2018: Everyone Controls Rewind, which also heavily featured Fortnite. Blevins appeared briefly during the NFL&rsquo;s &ldquo;The 100-Year Game&rdquo; ad alongside numerous several professional football players that aired during Super Bowl LIII in 2019. He was the only participant in the commercial with no ties whatsoever to football in any form.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On August 20, 2019, Blevins&rsquo; book Get Good: My Ultimate Guide to Gaming was published by Penguin Random House.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Ninja Charitable work</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In a fundraising charity stream held in February 2018, Blevins raised over $110,000 to be donated to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. During the first Fortnite Battle Royale Esports event in April 2018, Blevins gave away nearly $50,000 in prize money, with $2,500 of that going to the Alzheimer&rsquo;s Association. Later in April, he participated in the #Clips4Kids event with other fellow streamers DrLupo and TimTheTatman, and in total, he helped raise over $340,000. At E3 2018, Blevins and Marshmello won the Fortnite Pro-Am event which resulted in the donation of the $1 million prize to a charity of their choice.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Ninja Controversies</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Blevins has stated that he does not stream with female gamers out of respect for his wife and to avoid the rumors that such streaming could create. He received mixed reactions; some said that he should set an example and not make it more difficult for female streamers to rise to prominence, while others supported his stance, claiming that he should be allowed to do what he wants to protect his marriage. In response to his critics, Blevins has reaffirmed his support for gender equality and restated his commitment to his marriage, and mentioned some prominent female streamers by name. He has also made clear that women are welcome to play with him in a group or at events, saying that such situations allow him to &ldquo;control the narrative more, without stupid drama and rumors flooding into our lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In December 2016, Blevins released the address of a donor as retribution for having a racist screen name and donation message. This act, which is referred to as &ldquo;doxing&rdquo;, is against the Twitch rules, which states they can result in an &ldquo;indefinite suspension&rdquo;. Blevins was reported for this act, but only received a 48-hour suspension, which some believed was a result of Blevins&rsquo; large audience on the platform. Blevins later tweeted that he deserved the punishment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In March 2018, while in a stream with Nadeshot, Blevins improvised the word &ldquo;nigga&rdquo; while rapping to Logic&rsquo;s &ldquo;44 More&rdquo;. This sparked controversy within his watching community and the general public. He later apologized for any offense caused and stated that he did not intend to say the word, instead attributing his use of the word to being &ldquo;tongue-tied&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In October 2018, Blevins reported a player for &ldquo;having a higher ping&rdquo; than him. This led to a player claiming on November 16, 2018, that they had been banned as a result of the report, which Epic Games denied. Both of these incidents caused backlash against Blevins on social media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In November 2018, Blevins received criticism for falsely reporting IcyFive, a Fortnite player, for stream sniping. After Blevins was eliminated by IcyFive, Blevins&rsquo; teammate, DrLupo, told him to watch for an &ldquo;emote&rdquo;, which IcyFive did perform. Blevins took this as proof that IcyFive was stream sniping and quickly reported the player. After reporting IcyFive, Blevins stated that he would &ldquo;go out of his way&rdquo; to ensure IcyFive got banned and told IcyFive that he would not report him if he left the game immediately despite already having reported him. As IcyFive was not viewing the stream, he did not do so. Blevins assumed IcyFive was ignoring him and took out his phone in what appeared to be an attempt at directly contacting Epic Games. IcyFive claimed that he did not stream snipe Blevins and uploaded a video as proof. DrLupo later stated that he did not believe IcyFive stream sniped Blevins, mentioning that using an emote was a regular reaction to an increase in spectator count after elimination, and also stated that he did not condone Blevins&rsquo; actions, comparing them to a rant. Blevins later apologized to IcyFive on Twitter but also accused the player of &ldquo;playing the victim&rdquo; and &ldquo;milking&rdquo; the incident, calling him &ldquo;naive&rdquo; for assuming players would be banned solely on his word.</p>", "ref": "", "page_type": 1, "writer": null, "tags": [2, 66, 86]}}, {"model": "core.wiki", "pk": 12, "fields": {"title": "Ranboo", "slug": "ranboo", "avatar": 802, "created_at": "2022-04-09T12:15:16.313Z", "updated_at": "2022-05-04T08:13:56.655Z", "meta_title": "Ranboo", "meta_description": "<p>Ranboo</p>", "canonical_url": null, "index_page": true, "publish": true, "meta_images": null, "info_box": 362, "overview": "<p>He had risen to fame only recently, having opened his YouTube channel in January 2020.

Zand clutched the last life on the final map to secure the win.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Cizzorz Sky Station Showdown</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The first map of the Creative Finals was the Sky Station Showdown. The game mode focused on maintaining control of certain checkpoints. The area was slightly smaller than two tiles by two tiles. To earn points, a team must keep enemy players from entering the zone. The team must also stay within the zone. After the three matches, the team &ldquo;Funky Fighters&rdquo; won the challenge and earned themselves $100,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Cizzorz Junkyard Juke</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This game mode played like &ldquo;Prop Hunt.&rdquo; The major difference came from a central guard post in the middle where defending teams had to prevent players from reaching. The players outside of the guard post were disguised as various Fortnite items. They needed to avoid the guards&rsquo; sight while making their way toward the middle of the map. The teams rotated from the guards to props each round. Team &ldquo;Chicken Champions&rdquo; snuck out a win for a total of $110,000 in winnings.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Cizzorz World Run</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This Creative map played like the famous Death Run by Cizzorz. It included different jumps, runs, and technical abilities to navigate. Players avoided traps, used impulse grenades to jump, and moved precisely around obstacles. The time a team finished and the number of coins collected determined which team won. Unsurprisingly, the team with the creator of the Death Run, &ldquo;Fish Fam,&rdquo; won this challenge and their share of prize money.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Cizzorz Golden Games</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This mode took the three previous modes and introduced or removed a certain variable. For example, players respawned in the World Run mode at the last checkpoint. In the Golden Games, players received only one life to complete the challenge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Team Fish Fam and FaZe Cizzorz win the Fortnite World Cup Creative Finals</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Creative Finals came down to the very last moment. Zand, a player on Fish Fam, remained the only player alive on the revamped World Run. He needed one more coin to beat the other teams. After a long pause, Zand nailed the jump and collected the coin. Then the celebration began! Cizzorz, Suezhoo, and HiImTylerH surrounded him with excitement as they all just won $325,000 from Fortnite.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Cizzorz History</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Jack started as a Black Ops YouTuber in 2011, he currently only has 2 public videos about them.

Jack went on to Dect&rsquo;s stream and was asked Dect to take down the code. Dect did do so but then went against Jack for his behavior towards Dect. Jack did cuss at Dect (not in a way to harass or bully) because of the fury Jack was in. Dect went on a rant and claims Jack is being disrespectful and encouraged his fans to send hate toward Dect, which is not the case. Dect claims that he thought the code was public, which was why he shared the code and live-streamed himself playing the unreleased Death Run.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p>Jack did apologize for his behavior and Dect also apologized for leaking the code and for his behavior as well. Jack did also mention the hate people are giving towards other streamers, and hoping that he will never see those people again.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<h2>Milestones</h2>\r\n\r\n\t\t<h3>Subscriber Milestones</h3>\r\n\r\n\t\t<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"width:500px\">\r\n\t\t\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<td>1 million subscribers</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<td>March 1, 2018</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<td>2 million subscribers</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<td>June 6, 2018</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<td>3 million subscribers</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<td>November 28, 2018</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<td>4 million subscribers</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<td>March 3, 2019</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t\t</tbody>\r\n\t\t</table>\r\n\r\n\t\t<h3>Views Milestones</h3>\r\n\r\n\t\t<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"width:500px\">\r\n\t\t\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<td>100 million views</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<td>February 18, 2018</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<td>200 million views</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<td>May 19, 2018</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<td>300 million views</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<td>September 10, 2018</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<td>400 million views</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<td>January 21, 2019</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t\t</tbody>\r\n\t\t</table>\r\n\t\t</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>", "ref": "", "page_type": 1, "writer": null, "tags": [2, 66, 67]}}, {"model": "core.wiki", "pk": 16, "fields": {"title": "DrDisRespect", "slug": "drdisrespect", "avatar": 797, "created_at": "2022-04-09T12:18:23.625Z", "updated_at": "2022-05-04T08:02:45.307Z", "meta_title": "DrDisRespect", "meta_description": "<p>DrDisRespect</p>", "canonical_url": null, "index_page": true, "publish": true, "meta_images": null, "info_box": 366, "overview": "<p>Herschel Guy Beahm IV better known online as <a href=\"/setup/drdisrespect/\">DrDisRespect </a>is an American YouTuber, streamer, and gamer, who has gained success for his appearance on live streams.

He was reportedly struggling to search &ldquo;for words and issued several stuttering responses to questions&rdquo; about it during one of the interviews.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On August 6, after 42 days of not streaming, he tweeted a link to his YouTube channel with the caption &ldquo;Tomorrow, we arrive.&rdquo;He went live on YouTube at the same time, but the stream only showed a looping video of a custom Champions Club gas station.

Felix was an outgoing kid and often spent his time skateboarding or snowboarding.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He used to study at CEGEP where he was supposed to get a degree in administration. However, he dropped out to become a streamer on Twitch and play League of Legends. XQC was passionate about video games as a kid and his dream was to make a living out of his passion. He later discovered Overwatch and began streaming tons of gameplay and gathering an audience.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is known that XQC was trying out different usernames to check if they are available.

Haag and OpTic Gaming went on to finish in the 5th/6th position. At the Call of Duty Championships, OpTic Gaming finished in third place losing to the eventual winners of the tournament. They then played in Gfinity 1 (G1) in London, United Kingdom and MLG Anaheim in Anaheim, California where were placed in third respectively at both events. The next event Haag attended was Gfinity (G2) in London. However, their new roster finished 9th&ndash;12th Their performance at the MLG Fullsail Invitational, where the four highest ranked Black Ops II teams competed, (and which was to be OpTic Gaming and MLG&rsquo;s final event of the Call of Duty: Black Ops II competitive season) was much improved, finishing in second place. In first was a team by the name of Complexity Gaming</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Call of Duty: Ghosts 2013&ndash;14 season</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The next title of the Call of Duty franchise was Call of Duty: Ghosts which MLG announced that it would be their featured FPS title for the upcoming season again. Haag and OpTic Gaming disappointed at both of their first two events which were to be MLG Columbus (13&ndash;16th place) and UMG Philadelphia (9&ndash;12th place) before a roster change occurred with one player retiring, two leaving and one later rejoining. During this time Haag teamed with Christopher Duarte, who goes by the name of &lsquo;Parasite&rsquo;. At this time, the team consisted of &lsquo;NaDeSHoT&rsquo;, &lsquo;Clayster&rsquo;, &lsquo;Ricky&rsquo; and &lsquo;Parasite&rsquo;. However, after only a handful of days, &lsquo;Parasite&rsquo; and &lsquo;Ricky&rsquo; left OpTic to join Curse Las Vegas. OpTic then picked up &lsquo;Saints&rsquo; and &lsquo;MBoZe&rsquo;, before &lsquo;Scumpii&rsquo; rejoined OpTic to replace the departing &lsquo;Saints&rsquo;, who returned to Strictly Business. After the retirement of &lsquo;BigTymer&rsquo; following UMG Philadelphia, Haag became the captain of OpTic Gaming</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Optic, led by Haag, qualified for the Call of Duty: Ghosts national qualifiers for the annual Call of Duty Championship $1,000,000 tournaments after qualifying via MLG&rsquo;s online qualifying tournament. At the US Championship Finals OpTic Gaming finished in 7th place to qualify for the Call of Duty World Championship, after eliminating Curse New York in an elimination game in a best of 5 series. This allowed the team to qualify for the annual $1 million tournament. Haag and his OpTic Gaming squad played in the MLG Pro Circuit Season 1 online league where after a promising start they suffered problems online and were not able to qualify for the MLG PAX East Championship; eventually OpTic Gaming finished bottom of the league in 10th place. OpTic Gaming later announced that Haag and his teammates would be hosting the winners of the US Regional finals, Strictly Business Gaming for a pre-LAN event for the World Championships.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the Call of Duty World Championships, OpTic were placed in a group with &lsquo;Epsilon eSports&rsquo;, &lsquo;NSP&rsquo; and &lsquo;SSOF&rsquo;; controversy was caused when &lsquo;SSOF&rsquo; were disqualified and OpTic only had two teams in their group. OpTic first played &lsquo;NSP&rsquo; and beat them 3-0 leading to a group decider against Epsilon where Haag and his team lost 3-0. However they advanced as the second seed and faced tK in the first round of the winners bracket. Haag led his team to a 3&ndash;0 victory against a team considered to be a top three team by many. In the second round Haag was to come up against Strictly Business Gaming who they had hosted in a pre-LAN event, however Haag and his teammates won 3&ndash;2 and played Australian team Trident T1 Dotters for a guaranteed top three finish. OpTic Gaming led by Haag won the series 3&ndash;1 and guaranteed themselves 3rd and $120,000. OpTic were then to face CompLexity who were undefeated on Call of Duty: Ghosts and came up short in the winners bracket finals losing 3&ndash;2. OpTic then lost to Team EnVyUs in the losers bracket finals and Haag led his team to a top three finish and won his cut of $30,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shortly after the Call of Duty World Championships, Haag signed an exclusivity contract with MLG to stream himself playing Call of Duty on MLG&rsquo;s MLG.tv web streaming service. On April 15, 2014, OpTic Gaming announced that Marcus &lsquo;MBoZe&rsquo; Blanks would be leaving the team in order for Jordan &lsquo;ProoFy&rsquo; Cannon to join the team. The OpTic Gaming roster (Haag&rsquo;s teammates) for UGC Niagara and for the 2014 season Call of Duty:Ghosts season was Seth &lsquo;Scumpii&rsquo; Abner, James &lsquo;Clayster&rsquo; Eubanks and Jordan &lsquo;ProoFy&rsquo; Cannon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the new roster&rsquo;s first tournament together, a disappointing first day lead to them having to play the world&rsquo;s best team, and eventual winners of UGC Niagara, CompLexity Gaming, who proved too strong for Haag&rsquo;s team. They narrowly won every map to take a 3&ndash;0 series win and knock Haag and his OpTic Gaming team out of the tournament. Before and after UGC Niagara Haag competed with his team in the MLG Pro Circuit Season 2 in order to qualify for MLG Anaheim&rsquo;s pro team tournament to contest for a $70,000 prize pool. Haag&rsquo;s team qualified, being second place in the league.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Haag and his OpTic Gaming team were invited to the MLG X Games on the Xbox One after finishing in the top 3 at the Call of Duty World Championships. They went into the event as underdogs after a disappointing tournament at UGC Niagara, however Haag and his team were able to win their group after beating Team EnVyUs and FaZe Red 3&ndash;1 to set up a semi final match against Evil Geniuses,(formerly known as CompLexity). Evil Geniuses were favorites to win the event after a dominant year at LAN events, but Haag and his three teammates were able to beat them 3&ndash;1 to face Team Kaliber in the Grand Finals. They managed to beat Team Kaliber in a match that came down to a Game 5, Round 10 in Search &amp; Destroy, and Haag was able to win a Gold Medal and his first MLG Championship at the X Games in Austin, Texas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Haag was voted by fans as The Game Awards 2014 eSports Player of the Year. He took a trip out to Las Vegas with some of his teammates and sponsors to accept this award.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare 2014&ndash;15 season</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Advanced Warfare will be the next installment in the Call Of Duty Franchise for the e-sports circuit. The season formally began November 2014. Haag was invited by Activision to Los Angeles for a preview of Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare in order to advise developers on the state of the game. On October 28, 2014 OpTic Gaming, led by Haag, participated in an exclusive Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare streaming event at the so-called &lsquo;OpTic House&rsquo; in Chicago, in order to promote the new edition in the franchise for its creators, Sledgehammer Games</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In season opening competition, MLG Columbus, Haag and his team achieved second place, losing out to FaZe in the Grand Final. This was a sad loss for OpTic and Haag, as they hadn&rsquo;t dropped a map all day until the grand finals. OpTic looked like they were going to win it all until they ran into Faze Clan in the finals. Faze narrowly took the victory, going all the way to a second best of five series.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second tournament Haag competed in with OpTic was at UMG Orlando. Haag and his team achieved first place this time around. They went 0&ndash;2 in the first day of competition but his team managed to bounce back and with their other two games in pool play on the second day of competition. On Championship Sunday OpTic were crowned victorious as they beat a young team known as Stunner Gaming 3&ndash;1 in the grand finals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Twelve teams qualified, including Haag&rsquo;s team, for Pro League Season 1: Prophecy, FaZe, Justus, Aware, Automatic Reload, EnVyUs, Denial, eLevate, Rise Nation, Team KaLiBeR, OpTic Nation, and OpTic Gaming. Haag&rsquo;s team now consists of Ian &ldquo;Crimsix&rdquo; Porter, Seth &ldquo;Scumpii&rdquo; Abner, and Matthew &ldquo;Formal&rdquo; Piper. OpTic Gaming were to go 38&ndash;6 in the MLG Season 1 Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare and qualified with the number one seed for the playoffs which they completed at with a $75,000 prize pool. OpTic Gaming went into the event led by NaDeSHoT and hoped to become the first team to win a LAN tournament without dropping a map. They went on to beat Rise Nation 3&ndash;0, they then came up against a team with young players called Aware Gaming who they beat 3&ndash;1 however this meant they did not become the first team to win an event without dropping a map. They then faced Team Kaliber in the winners bracket final who they narrowly beat 3&ndash;2 before progressing to the grand finals where they beat Denial eSports 3&ndash;0 to win their second event in a row. This was Haag&rsquo;s second win of an MLG event after winning previously at X Games during the Call of Duty: Ghosts season.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On April 4, 2015, NaDeSHoT announced that he was stepping down as captain and member of the OpTic Gaming pro-team. He said that he will become a full-time content creator as well as co-owner of the OpTic organization. He was replaced on the lineup by Damon &ldquo;Karma&rdquo; Barlow.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Nadeshot Biography</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Call of Duty 4 and Modern Warfare 2</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Matt &ldquo;NaDeSHoT&rdquo; Haag, started his competitive Call of Duty career in Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare with team Genesis. NaDeSHoT had his first top 8 placement at MLG National Championship 2009 during Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare season with the same team, finishing 4th. After Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, NaDeSHoT went to OpTic Gaming for the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 season. Here, Nade would find two 8th place finishes at MLG Online National Championship and MLG National Championship 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Black Ops and Modern Warfare 3</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Matt would stay on the Optic Gaming squad heading into the Call of Duty: Black Ops season. Here, he would find a 3rd place finish at MLG Dallas 2011 before being moved to OpTic Nation. After a 6th place finish at MLG Columbus 2011, Nadeshot would be released from OpTic, and would find himself on Team EnVyUs. He would find two more Top 8 finishes while on EnVy as the Black Ops season came to a close. During the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 season, Matt would find himself back on Optic Gaming. Nadeshot and the squad of MerK, BigTymeR, and Vengeance would win Call of Duty XP, but after a 3rd place finish at UMG Classic, he was once again released from OpTic Gaming. At the UMG Invitational, he would find himself on JuKeD, where he would place 4th. Finally, he would place 3rd at the UMG Championships with a pick up team to finish the season.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Black Ops 2</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>NaDeSHoT would find himself back on OpTic once again for the Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 season. Here, along with Scump, MerK, and BigTymeR, they would find their highest placing early in the season, finishing 1st at UMG Chicago. The team would go on to place 3rd at the Call of Duty Championship, and would not place out of the top 10 for the rest of the season. However, many would begin to question why the team had dropped Rambo in favor of NaDeSHoT. Eventually, OpTic would replace MerK with JKap, and this line up would finish with a 2nd place finish at the MLG Fall Invitational 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Ghosts</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Nadeshot and company would have a rough start to the Call of Duty: Ghosts season, finishing outside of the top 10 at the first 2 events they would attend. The team would go through a flurry of roster changes at one point, including Ricky, Saints, and Parasite, and the retirement of BigTymeR. Scump would leave the team for a week to join Team EnVyUs, siting a rivalry with Nadeshot as the reason. However, Scump would return, and the team would be complete with Nadeshot, Scump, MBoZe, and Clayster. Many doubted the team heading into the Call of Duty Championship 2014, especially after barely qualifying at the U.S. Regional tournament, but the team would make a strong run, finishing 3rd overall for the 2nd year in a row. After Champs, OpTic would make a surprise move by reviving OpTic Nation, with MBoZe as the captain. OpTic would bring on ProoFy to fill his spot, and the squad would head into UGC Niagara 2014 with high expectations. However, the squad would finish in 7th place, with many questioning why they made the change at all. Optic Gaming would then attend the MLG X Games Invitational 2014, where NaDeSHoT would show his Search and Destroy prowess, helping lead OpTic Gaming to a win over Team Kaliber in the Grand Finals, and becoming the first Call of Duty X Games gold medalists. Following this win, NaDeSHoT and the rest of the OpTic Gaming squad went into MLG Anaheim 2014 full of confidence and looked to turn their 2nd seed from Season 2 of the MLG CoD league into a victory. They would take out all opposition 3-0 until they faced Evil Geniuses who knocked them down into the losers bracket final. They went onto beat TCM-Gaming 3-0 in this series and faced Evil Geniuses again in the Championship final. However, the lost the continuation series and finished with a very convincing 2nd. OpTic Gaming would then look to carry this form over to London at Gfinity 3 but they were unable to, finishing with a disappointing 5th-8th with no-one really performing. Following this disappointment they looked to bounce back at UMG Dallas 2014, but only did so in part, finishing 4th and taking away $2,000 after crashing out at the hands of OpTic Nation who beat them with a convincing 3-0. NaDeSHoT and his teammates at OpTic Gaming finished 3rd in the Season 3 of the MLG CoD league, and secured the 3rd seed going into the Season 3 Playoff. In the Season 3 of the MLG league playoff they lost in the first round against Denial eSports, after beating both Rise Nation and OpTic Nation with a convincing 3-0, NaDeSHoT and his team lost 3-0 to Most Wanted, OpTic Gaming finished in 4th place to close out the Call of Duty: Ghosts season..</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Advanced Warfare</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Nadeshot and company began the Advanced Warfare season well at MLG Columbus Open 2014 as they placed second, losing out to FaZe Clan in the Grand Final after OpTic Gaming released Clayster and ProoFy for FormaL and Crimsix. OpTic Gaming went on to win three consecutive tournaments: UMG Orlando 2015, MLG Pro League Season 1 Playoffs, and the Call of Duty Championship 2015: NA Regional Finals. However, at the Call of Duty Championship 2015, OpTic Gaming got a disappointing 7th place finish, shocking everyone involved. On 04/04/2015, feeling that he was the reason for his team&rsquo;s poor performance at CoD Champs 2015, Nadeshot announced that he would be &ldquo;taking a break&rdquo; from competitive Call of Duty, and would be focusing more on his YouTube channel and live streaming. This shocked all the competitive Call of Duty community, as well as most of the pros. It was later announced that Karma would replace him on OpTic Gaming.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Post Retirement</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>On April 18, 2016, NaDeSHoT announced on his YouTube channel that he created his own organization known as &ldquo;Hundred Thieves.&rdquo; He had acquired a team that had recently qualified for Stage 2 of the 2016 COD World League North America Pro Division that went by the name of, &ldquo;King Papey,&rdquo; to be the first team in any eSports to represent his organization. He also announced that this organisation will not be limited to Call of Duty eSports and is interested in the idea of picking up teams in games like Counter Strike: Global Offensive, Dota, and others.</p>", "ref": "", "page_type": 1, "writer": null, "tags": [2, 16, 66, 117]}}, {"model": "core.wiki", "pk": 38, "fields": {"title": "Stable Ronaldo", "slug": "stable-ronaldo", "avatar": 775, "created_at": "2022-04-09T12:32:41.878Z", "updated_at": "2022-05-04T07:07:45.511Z", "meta_title": "Stable Ronaldo", "meta_description": "<p>Stable Ronaldo</p>", "canonical_url": null, "index_page": true, "publish": true, "meta_images": null, "info_box": 335, "overview": "<p><a href=\"/setup/stable-ronaldo/\">Stable Ronaldo</a> is a professional Fortnite player, and also a relevant streamer on the platform Twitch.

He started playing games at an early age which mainly consisted of MMOs directed toward children. His favorite game was Disney&rsquo;s Club Penguin. He was introduced to Fortnite by his brother when it was released in 2017. Soon he was addicted to the game and played almost regularly honing his skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He played Fortnite every night until 11 pm, right after he had finished dinner and his homework from school. Shaun recalls having a standing proclivity towards Rubik&rsquo;s cubes, this made him realize that he enjoyed strategic problem-solving. All of these traits alongside tons of practice and self-discipline have contributed to Epikwhale&rsquo;s exceptional skill in Fortnite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shaun is still studying and does prioritize his studies. His schoolwork is extremely important to him, and he attends to his duties regularly. He has shared that his discipline and time management are also skills that he has worked on.

He was successful in qualifying for the Fortnite World Cup finals. This raised the attention of many big organizations and he joined NRG Esports in July of 2019. He was their youngest member at the time being only 16. Epikwhale was later ranked 3rd in the Fortnite World Cup Finals which earned him USD 1.2 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He has decided to take a gap year after finishing high school to pursue his professional career in Fortnite alongside NRG Esports. His parents and family are very supportive of his goals and ambitions. This comes as no surprise given his talent and achievements in the e-sports scene thus far. His older brother still plays Fortnite with him and supports him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shaun is ranked #70 in overall earnings and #6 among the highest-earning players from America. He had earned around USD 1.3 million from tournaments and cash prizes even before he turned 18. It took him 34 tournaments and it accounts for more than 95% of his net worth even today. The biggest cash prize he has won was the $1,200,000.00 from Fortnite World Cup Finals Solo-2019. His 3rd place finish makes up for more than 80% of his net worth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shaun achieved success in a short span of just 8 tournaments, breaking the 100 grand mark on his prize earnings.

After the new version came out in 2012, he didn&rsquo;t take much liking to it at first, but after a few years and with a lot of encouragement from his cousin Nikola &ldquo;⁠NiKo⁠&rdquo; Kovač, huNter- eventually gave it a real try and began to play more in 2015-2016 with some of his old teammates from the 1.6 days in GamePub, as well as with NiKo himself in The World Championships qualifiers as a representative of Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After he started to make a name for himself again on the local scene, in 2016 huNter- was called up by Nestor &ldquo;⁠LETN1⁠&rdquo; Tanić to one of the most well-known teams in the Balkan region, iNation. huNter soon began to show that he had the talent for more than just local play. The then-20-year-old averaged a 1.14 rating in his first full year in CS:GO after competing in various regional and international tournaments and qualifiers, and he kept climbing the ranks from then on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>huNter- began his Counter-Strike journey already in the late years Of 1.6. At his young age, he didn&rsquo;t have enough time to work his way up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next step in huNter-&lsquo;s career came in 2017, when the iNation roster signed with Binary Dragons and the Bosnian went full-time under the Russian organization. With the new backing, the team went on to attend as much as they could &mdash; more than 30 tournaments and over 200 maps in a span of eight months with the organization &mdash; to rack up some much-needed experience, and huNter- got the opportunity to play his first international LAN events, at the Copenhagen Games BYOC qualifier and at DreamHack Open Atlanta, though without success in either campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By May of 2018, the Balkan squad broke through to the top 30 for the first time after they qualified for DreamHack Masters Marseille, placed in the top six at the year&rsquo;s Copenhagen Games event, and reached the playoffs at Qi Invitational. But despite huNter- continuing to impress, Valiance began to stagnate in the latter half of the year, which eventually prompted the organization to overhaul the roster and reach beyond the talent pool in the Balkan scene with the addition of Imperial&rsquo;s star trio, Nemanja &ldquo;⁠nexa⁠&rdquo; Isaković, Rokas &ldquo;⁠EspiranTo⁠&rdquo; Milasauskas, and Otto &ldquo;⁠ottoNd⁠&rdquo; Sihvo.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Transfer To G2</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>huNter&rsquo;s transfer to <a href=\"/wiki/g2-esports/\">G2 </a>less than a month after their campaign in Berlin was surprising.

The team was regularly participating in German competitions but didn&rsquo;t leave a mark in European tournaments, which syrsoN explains wasn&rsquo;t for a lack of trying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What followed was a step up to ALTERNATE aTTaX, the organization syrsoN would spend almost three years in, playing with a plethora of different players and undergoing a big role swap later on. In 2016, the team had Kevin &ldquo;⁠keev⁠&rdquo; Bartholom&auml;us as their star AWPer, while syrsoN was one of the four less-impactful riflers (0.99 rating from 170 maps played).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an individually unimpressive year, syrsoN still managed some big team-based achievements. At the age of 20, syrsoN played his first ESEA Premier season (Season 22, finished 3rd-4th), and took part in his first and only Big Event to date, ELEAGUE Season 2, after a massive upset over Jesper &ldquo;⁠JW⁠&rdquo; Wecksell&rsquo;s GODSENT in the final game of the qualifier. While the German side crashed out of the prestigious tournament after three maps and losses to Astralis (ranked 13th in the world) and Natus Vincere (third), just a few weeks later they got their first-ever LAN trophy, even including German events, by winning ESWC 2016 as the sixth-highest ranked squad in Paris.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shortly after lifting the trophy at ESWC, ALTERNATE aTTaX reached its peak in the world ranking at No.22. Changes were imminent, though, as keep was called up to <a href=\"/wiki/bigclan/\">BIG </a>based on a year of solid showings, while syrsoN picked up the &lsquo;Big Green&rsquo;, drawing from his sniping experience in Counter-Strike: Source. While the team trended downward throughout 2017, syrsoN&rsquo;s form picked up as he fully committed to the game. He posted a 1.11 rating in ESEA MDL Season 24 between February and April, but it was only after an in-game leader change at the end of the year that the German AWPer started to flourish and consistently deliver.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Rise To Fame</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>While the team never managed to break into the top 30 or win an international title, syrsoN gained notoriety in the European sub-top, putting up enviable performances in nearly every outing. Across 2018, he played 336 maps and averaged a 1.20 rating, doing slightly better against the best opposition he played with a 1.23 rating against the top 30 squads (46 maps). Surpassing his level from 2017, when he had managed just a 1.07 rating for the year, syrsoN had proven his capabilities as a star AWPer and was on to a new challenge soon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SyrsoN decided against renewing his contract with the organization he had been a part of since 2016. As Sprout was looking to go back to a full-German lineup, the move was obvious, and he picked up where he left off in his last team. With a stronger core of players around him, he took the next step in his career, becoming a part of a fairly consistent top-30 squad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the 12 months that he spent with the team, syrsoN only managed to win two domestic titles from DreamHack Leipzig international and ESL Meisterschaft Winter 2019 Finals but picked up up several second places at events such as Charleroi Esports, Copenhagen Games 2019, Games Clash Masters, and DreamHack Open Atlanta. A big breakthrough came online, though, as Sprout battled through the relegation tournament to qualify for ESL Pro League Season 10. In the four maps played, syrsoN was again the standout player, posting a 1.33 rating against Heretics and NIP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the Pro League group stage, which was held on LAN in London, Sprout came out short in all three matches played, but only by the smallest margins. Over nine maps, the German side won more rounds than they lost, leaving a great impression despite the final result.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>BIG Clan</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Achieving what he could with Sprout and showing an admirable level online (1.16 rating), on LAN (1.18 rating), and against the best opposition he was able to play (1.16 rating vs top 20, 54 maps), his destination was obvious &ndash; the German trailblazers BIG. The German giants, who had made history with their runs at the PGL Krakow 2017 Major and ESL One Cologne 2018, had been in turmoil for most of 2019, even falling behind Sprout in the rankings at certain points, but for syrsoN, joining the team alongside Nils &ldquo;⁠k1to⁠&rdquo; Gruhne and reuniting with tiziaN was not a hard decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A poor end to the previous year and two-player changes meant that BIG began 2020 ranked as low as 46th in the world, having to prove their worth before syrsoN and co. could begin competing at the most prestigious events, which count the most towards the top 20 players of the year ranking. BIG had a slow start, losing to domestic rivals Sprout in their first match played and failing to qualify for DreamHack Open Anaheim, being eliminated by AVEZ.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The German side also didn&rsquo;t have a spot at IEM Katowice, the biggest LAN event of the year, but showed signs of what was to come on home soil, at DreamHack Open Leipzig. Despite being the lowest-ranked team coming into it, BIG won the event dominantly, giving up just nine rounds per map played on average, outplacing squads within the top 20 such as Heroic and MAD Lions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the restructuring of ESL Pro League, BIG was one of the teams that were left out in the cold, so they decided to travel to Los Angeles at the beginning of March to try to qualify for Flashpoint 1 &mdash; which they did, although they ended up skipping the $1 million competition. The global pandemic changed everyone&rsquo;s plans, though, and with LANs canceled and competitions going online, BIG was invited to Pro League S11 after all.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Achievements</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>syrsoN showed what he was made of in the event, helping BIG to kick off the tournament with group stage wins over Fnatic (ranked sixth) and Natus Vincere (first), but his team had to settle for a disappointing 16-18th finish after losing the remaining three games to lesser opposition. The AWPer averaged a 1.10 rating across 13 maps played, with high impact as well (1.22 impact rating) and success both in opening up rounds (0.18 opening kills per round) and clutching (6 1vXs won).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a 1.21 rating for the event, as well as an incredible 1.43 CT side rating and a 1.26 rating in playoff matches, syrsoN scooped the MVP award, the first of his career, but there was little time to celebrate as cs_summit 6 was around the corner. syrsoN was again a stable contributor to his team and didn&rsquo;t drop off in the playoffs (1.13 rating), but it was the wunderkind Mathieu &ldquo;⁠ZywOo⁠&rdquo; Herbaut from the losing side that snagged the MVP, leaving the German with only a place among the Exceptionally Valuable Players (EVPs).</p>", "ref": "", "page_type": 2, "writer": null, "tags": [16, 105, 106, 69]}}, {"model": "core.wiki", "pk": 58, "fields": {"title": "TaySon", "slug": "tayson", "avatar": 818, "created_at": "2022-04-09T12:59:30.506Z", "updated_at": "2022-05-03T15:19:53.555Z", "meta_title": "TaySon", "meta_description": "<p>TaySon</p>", "canonical_url": null, "index_page": true, "publish": true, "meta_images": null, "info_box": 327, "overview": "<p>TaySon</p>", "body": "<h2>TaySon Career</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>EU is a Slovenian organization.

Not long afterward, he and teammates Sergey &ldquo;⁠spaz⁠&rdquo; Skrypchik and Roman &ldquo;⁠CyberFocus⁠&rdquo; Dergach transferred to Rebels, the team with which electronic would play his first Minor, the StarLadder Regional Minor Championship CIS. He was the third highest-rated player at that event, with a 1.15 rating.

Raise Your Edge Gaming was an esports team based in Europe that was later renamed Acend. Santeri &lsquo;BONECOLD&rsquo; Sassi, Vladyslav &lsquo;Kiles&rsquo; Shvets, and Patryk&rsquo;starxo&rsquo; Kopczynski, all former CNed colleagues, were scouted into Acend. Jett and Sage are CNed&rsquo;s principal agents</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Raise Your Edge Gaming</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Champions Tour Europe Stage 1: Challengers 1</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under the name Raise Your Edge Gaming, CNed only entered one tournament. Up until the round of 32, all Challengers 1 matchups were BO1s. For CNed, the BO1s was a breeze, as he breezed past TwistedMinds and Prophecy ESC. In RO32, FunPlus Phoenix presented the first genuine challenge. In the series, CNed faced Jett and Raze, but they were defeated 2-0 by FunPlus. With a K/D of +7, CNed was the only player on his side with a positive K/D. He had 43 frags throughout the course of two maps, leading his team to victory on both occasions. He had an ADR of 170 and 8 First Kills on average.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNed and the team responded with a 2-0 win over Team Vitality. CNed played Jett on both maps and had a lot of mid-round influence with the Operator. On the side of Raise Your Edge, his relentless sniper netted him a number of kills and rounds. CNed was second to none with 39 kills, outflagging the server by a razor-thin margin. He had 9 first kills and a +6 kill-to-death ratio. This was his breakthrough performance, establishing him as a European talent. He had an ADR of 148 on average.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, in the Quarter Finals, Raise Your Edge went on a winning spree, defeating SAW, Rix.GG, and even OG. It was unexpected to see a team of young amateurs defeat OG 2-0 in a BO3 match. It might be stated that RYE Gaming deserved to win because they didn&rsquo;t even need CNed to do so. CNed had 26 kills and a respectable ADR of 132 in the 2-0 win over Ascent and Bind. He provided entries for his squad on Attack and was generally the first person to enter each location, aside from a decent score sheet.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Acend</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Champions Tour Europe Stage 1: Masters<br />\r\nWith the acquisition of Aleksander &lsquo;zeek&rsquo; Zygmunt, the team later changed its name to <a href=\"/wiki/acend/\">Acend</a>. They won the VCT EU S1 Masters and received a cash prize of $60,000. The team went on a tear after losing 2-0 to Ninjas In Pajamas in the Opening Main Event, going undefeated for the rest of the tournament. In the knockout match, Acend defeated Ballista 2-0, with CNed leading his side from the front on his Jett. He was simply invincible against a squad of novices, with 35 kills and a +22 Kill Differential.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Acend then went on to win the Decider 2-0 over the Ninjas. With his distinctive agent, CNed was once again guiding his squad to the front. This time, though, he was assisted by BONECOLD, the best player on the server. He had an ACS of 280 and a headshot percentage of 40%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Semi-finals, Acend defeated FunPlus Phoenix in a similar fashion. This was a tough match that went the distance, necessitating a third map decider to separate the two sides. In the series, CNed had 67 kills and put up a dominant effort to help his team win and advance to the Grand Finals. He had a +19 K/D and 180 ADR, according to his stats. In addition, he had 11 First Kills.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Grand Finals</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Acend and Team Heretics battled it out in a best-of-five match in the Grand Final. It was a tight final between two high-caliber teams that pushed one other to their maximum. The game went the distance, as Acend finally defeated Ascent 13-11 to claim the title of Grand Champions. CNed recorded 111 kills and a positive K/D of +30 in the Grand Finals, easily his best performance on the grandest stage of his career. He had 21 First Kills and annihilated the Heretics&rsquo; defence. His kills were complimented by a 277 ACS and a 170 ADR.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Acend had reached its pinnacle as a team and a force to be reckoned with at this point. They have yet to land a second VCT Master, having fallen to Vitality in the quarterfinals earlier this year. Then there was the loss in the Berlin Masters QF to 100 Thieves. They are currently competing in the VCT: Champions and have won two group stage matches.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Controversies</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Scam of Turkish Money Laundering &ldquo;cNed&rdquo; pek, admitted to being engaged in the Twitch money laundering incident on broadcast. Riot Games is investigating several Turkish VALORANT pros who have been implicated in the issue. The scandal involves consumers donating significant sums of money to streamers using stolen credit cards, with the streamers splitting the money with the donors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to cNed, he never had direct contact with the scandal&rsquo;s mastermind, but was instead linked to him through his brother, Alihan &ldquo;deNc&rdquo; pek. CNed further stated that one of the strategies employed by the offender to persuade streamers to split the money was threatening to contribute so many bits that Twitch would shut down their channel permanently and take away all earnings, as he claimed to have witnessed with a friend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no word yet on whether this issue will have an impact on his team&rsquo;s standing.</p>", "ref": "", "page_type": 2, "writer": null, "tags": [16, 64, 81, 79]}}, {"model": "core.wiki", "pk": 71, "fields": {"title": "s1mple", "slug": "s1mple", "avatar": 841, "created_at": "2022-04-09T13:15:32.046Z", "updated_at": "2022-05-03T14:24:29.974Z", "meta_title": "s1mple Wiki", "meta_description": "<p>s1mple</p>", "canonical_url": null, "index_page": true, "publish": true, "meta_images": 2, "info_box": 104, "overview": "", "body": "<h2>s1mple Carrer</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"/setup/s1mple/\">S1mple </a>was born in Kyiv, Ukraine.

He started playing Counter-Strike at four years old at the recommendation of his older brother. S1mple picked up Counter-Strike: Global Offensive shortly after its release in 2012, joining his first professional team a year later.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>S1mple Career</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>2014</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>S1mple&rsquo;s first team was a team called LAN DODGERS, but he was soon signed by Courage Gaming. Around September 2014, s1mple was signed by a large organization known as Hellraisers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There, he joined ANGE1, Dosia, Kucher, and Markeloff, who s1mple considers his idol.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2015</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In January 2015, s1mple was soon removed from Hellraisers due to his inflammatory comments about Germans, and an ESL wire ban for cheating. This ban was also extended to 2016 due to ban evasion. S1mple himself says that the ban was from cheating in Counter-Strike 1.6. The global offensive community has however raised doubts about the ban being from CS 1.6. There are claims stating that there is evidence that the ESL wire ban is from Counter-Strike Global Offensive. No comments regarding this have been made from ESL. S1mple was soon after signed by Flipsid3 Tactics, but his time in the team would be cut short due to the team&rsquo;s semi-final exit at ESWC 2015. Contrary to his teammates, s1mple wasn&rsquo;t happy about the result. At this period in his career, s1mple was known for being quite &ldquo;toxic,&rdquo; or rude to his teammates.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2016</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>After a short stint studying Chinese at a university, s1mple moved to America in early 2016 and joined Team Liquid. A Team Liquid player, Spencer &ldquo;Hiko&rdquo; Martin, was standing in for Flipsid3 at ESWC 2015, and he developed a friendly relationship with s1mple there. Team Liquid was surprised at the first major, and reached the semifinals of MLG Major Championship: Columbus, before falling to the eventual champions, Luminosity Gaming. Despite this result at the game&rsquo;s biggest tournament, it wouldn&rsquo;t be long before s1mple would leave Team Liquid, citing homesickness. The next major of the year was approaching, and s1mple once again played for Team Liquid. During the semifinals at ESL One Cologne 2016, Valve Corporation added graffiti on Cache commemorating s1mple&rsquo;s falling AWP play against Fnatic. Thus, Team Liquid became the first North American team to reach a major final. They were stopped in the finals by the same Brazilian lineup of SK (formerly Luminosity Gaming). After leaving Team Liquid, he replaced Danylo &ldquo;Zeus&rdquo; Teslenko on Natus Vincere.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>With Na&rsquo;Vi, s1mple won ESL One: New York 2016, and he was awarded the #4 placement in the HLTV top 20.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>2017</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>During the first major of the year, ELEAGUE Major 2017, Na&rsquo;Vi lost to Astralis during the quarterfinals. After a group stage exit at PGL 2017 Krakow Major Championship, Na&rsquo;Vi benched Ladislav &ldquo;GuardiaN&rdquo; Kovacs and Denis &ldquo;seized&rdquo; Kostin former-member Danylo &ldquo;Zeus&rdquo; Teslenko. GuardiaN had been the AWPer for Na&rsquo;Vi, so s1mple was forced to take up the sniper rifle after his departure. Despite these changes, Na&rsquo;Vi continued their drought of results and found a replacement for seized in the form of Denis &ldquo;electronic&rdquo; Sharipov. s1mple didn&rsquo;t find much success in 2017, but he still kept up his form from the last year. S1mple was awarded the #8 placement in the HLTV top 20 this year, down from #4 in 2016 due to a lack of results in the team</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2018</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/navi/\">NAVi </a>started 2018 with a semi-final finish at ELEAGUE Major: Boston 2018. At the start of 2018, Brazilian organization MIBR attempted to sign s1mple and flamie. The deal was reportedly very close to being finished, but Na&rsquo;Vi asked for too high of a buyout, and the deal eventually fell through. After two 2nd-place finishes at Starladder &amp; i-League StarSeries Season 4 and Dreamhack Masters Marseille, Na&rsquo;Vi won their first event of the year at StarSeries &amp; i-League Season 5; they would follow it up with wins at CAC 2018, and ESL One Cologne 2018. S1mple won MVPs at StarSeries and Dreamhack Marseille, despite his team not winning the events. In the semifinals at Cologne, they beat the best team at the time, Astralis. Na&rsquo;Vi would lose to Astralis at the second major of the year, FACEIT Major: London 2018. Na&rsquo;Vi won their final event of the year, BLAST Pro Series: Copenhagen 2018, and s1mple would once again claim the MVP award. Due to s1mple&rsquo;s performance, he would be nominated for the #1 spot in the HLTV top 20 players of 2018. According the to statistics from HLTV, s1mple in 2018 had achieved the highest individual rating out of all previous top 20 players. He is considered one of the best players to ever play Counter-Strike.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2019</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Na&rsquo;Vi came 3rd to 4th in the first major of the year. S1mple would keep up his form from 2018, and receive an MVP at StarSeries Season 7. After this, Na&rsquo;Vi would eventually hit a slump and replace s1mple&rsquo;s long-time teammate Ioann &ldquo;Edward&rdquo; Sukhariev with Kirill &ldquo;Boombl4&rdquo; Mikhailov who was in September 2019 made the team&rsquo;s leader (or IGL).</p>", "ref": "", "page_type": 2, "writer": null, "tags": [16, 91, 92, 69]}}, {"model": "core.wiki", "pk": 72, "fields": {"title": "Dakotaz", "slug": "dakotaz", "avatar": 843, "created_at": "2022-04-09T13:16:20.453Z", "updated_at": "2022-05-03T14:17:38.047Z", "meta_title": "Dakotaz", "meta_description": "<p>Dakotaz</p>", "canonical_url": null, "index_page": true, "publish": true, "meta_images": null, "info_box": null, "overview": "<p>Brett Hoffman better known online as Dakotaz, is an American Twitch Streamer, YouTuber, and a professional Fortnite player.

He started his career in June 2018 when he sided with Mongraal to compete in numerous events, including the Fortnite World Cup Duo Championship.</p>", "body": "<h2>Mitr0 Career</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Fortnite is one of the most popular Esports titles today alongside Valorant and other shooters. This battle royale/sandbox game was released in 2017. It boasts a huge community and has over 4.8 million active players. Mitr0 is one of the famous names in the Fortnite community, constantly outperforming other professionals and winning tournaments. He is a competitive Fortnite player representing <a href=\"/wiki/team-liquid/\">Team Liquid.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>His first-ever major accomplishment on the professional stage was during the Fortnite Summer Skirmish in Europe. Mitr0 managed to finish 1st twice during the 3rd and 5th week. He also placed 1st during the 2nd and 3rd week of the Fortnite Fall Skirmish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since then, Mitr0 has performed exceptionally well in all of the tournaments he has participated in and has received tons of support from the Fortnite community. This includes some tournaments such as Winter Royale, Fortnite World Cup Duos, FNCS Season 4, and more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mitr0 also has a Twitch channel with over 800,000 followers, where he regularly streams Fortnite. He also uploads highlights of his Fortnite streams on YouTube where he has 736,000+ subscribers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Net Worth</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"/setup/mitr0/\">Mitr0</a>&rsquo;s earnings are predominantly cash prizes from the Fortnite tournaments he has participated in. Before MitrO even turned 18, he was awarded over $733,774 in cash prizes from 71 different tournaments. More than 90% of his total prize money/income was earned before June 6, 2020. Mitr0 stands at #2 in highest earnings from an esports player from the Netherlands. The biggest prize pool that Mitr0 has secured for himself was $225,000 from Fortnite World Cup Finals 2019 &ndash; Duo on July 27, 2019. His 6th place finish in the tournament still accounts for a majority of his net worth, up to 28% of his total prize money won.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mitr0&rsquo;s YouTube channel consistently gets more than 1.56 million views each month which amounts to 52,000 views each day. Since YouTube channels earn between $3 to $7 per a thousand views depending on the region, it&rsquo;s fair to assume that MitrO earns approximately around $7,000 every month or $84,000 yearly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mitr0 also has a popular Twitch channel which has garnered over 800,000 followers. He has a total of 9 million views and 4,000 average viewers. With Twitch channels earning between $3 to $10 per one thousand views, Mitr0 could be estimated to earn around $20 to $30 every stream.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mitr0 is not very active on Twitch and hence his Twitch channel doesn&rsquo;t have many followers and viewers as compared to other professional players. Factoring in his social media influence and his earnings on Twitch, YouTube, and sponsorships, MitrO&rsquo;s estimated net worth would be around $800,000 to $900,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mitr0 reached the $100,000 milestone when he obtained $100,000 in prize money earned on August 25, 2018. He achieved this feat with a $9,975 cash prize from his 4th place finish at Fortnite Summer Skirmish Series &ndash; Week 7 EU (Day 2). It took him cash prizes from 6 tournaments to reach this milestone Recently in the past few months Mitr0 has won $2,000 in cash prizes from a single tournament.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Controversies</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Underpaid by Team Atlantis</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>On September 15, 2019, a hashtag by the signs of &lsquo;#FreeMitrO&rsquo; started going viral on Twitter, among the Fortnite Competitive Community. It was meant to highlight Dmitri a young Fortnite player being underpaid by his organization, Team Atlantis. This has happened to other professionals as well, including some big names like &lsquo;Edgey&rsquo;, a member of FlyQuest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Team Atlantis took 2/3rds of the winnings from Dmitri. Having granted only $30,000 out of the $90,000 MitrO earned from the Trios Championship Series. Some Atlantis players have also expressed their concern claiming to have lost around 70% of their income from the Fortnite World Cup 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mitr0 joined Atlantis as an amateur before his success as a player and a streamer, having a very small community. However, after his spectacular performances, he surpassed the organization in terms of popularity and was unhappy with his contract. This resulted in him wanting to leave Atlantis back in Jan 2019. MitrO looked for an organization that was capable of handling a player of his caliber and fulfilling his demands. MitrO left Team Atlantis for Team Liquid on 27 September 2019.</p>", "ref": "", "page_type": 2, "writer": null, "tags": [16, 83, 67, 63]}}, {"model": "core.wiki", "pk": 83, "fields": {"title": "Daequan", "slug": "daequan", "avatar": 860, "created_at": "2022-04-09T13:27:02.477Z", "updated_at": "2022-05-03T13:25:33.455Z", "meta_title": "Daequan", "meta_description": "<p>Daequan</p>", "canonical_url": null, "index_page": true, "publish": true, "meta_images": null, "info_box": 315, "overview": "<p>Daequan Loco is an American YouTuber, Twitch Streamer, and a Professional Fortnite player.

And 1 floor below their impact area, Nick and Aydan fight it out. Nick accidentally switches to his heals, and Aydan takes the game again. To impress the viewers, Aydan uses the &lsquo;Slow Clap&rsquo; emote right after killing Nick.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Encounter #4</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The fourth encounter was also short. They both were in &ldquo;Trump Tower&rdquo; yet again. Aydan places a trap to prevent Nick from following him but moved to another path. Nick does hit Aydan with a shotgun. Aydan then throws a C4 remote explosive, successfully hitting Nick, and finishes Nick with the Submachine Gun as Nick was looking to push Aydan.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Fall Skirmish &ndash; Duo Partners</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Fortnite&rsquo;s second tournament Fall Skirmish occurred and was duo mode only. Nick and Aydan decided to become duo partners to attempt to play aggressively against other duo teams. They were successfully able to pop off and in 2 games, they both had 10 eliminations combined. They both also impressed the live viewers in almost the entire Fall Skirmish finals. Unfortunately, they did not win a game.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Hacked</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>On November 23, 2018, the NICKMERCS Fortnite account was hacked while playing Duo Scrims with Tfue.

In the following two years, he had the chance to witness first-hand the chasm between the world&rsquo;s finest and the best that his region could offer when he attended Adepto BH Open 2011, in Sarajevo, and DreamHack Bucharest 2012 as part of eu4ia and iNation. In both tournaments, Nexa&rsquo;s teams could not make it past the quarter-finals following blowout defeats to two different iterations of Fnatic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With CS: GO taking over and bringing the 1.6 and Source communities together, Nexa made the switch and continued to play with iNation, who added two more experienced players in Janko &ldquo;⁠YNk⁠&rdquo; Paunović and Nemanja &ldquo;⁠k1Ng0r⁠&rdquo; Bo&scaron;ković. The team failed to make the playoffs at Mad Catz Vienna and DreamHack Bucharest, hitting a brick wall every time they faced tougher opposition, such as VeryGames and LDLC, but their breakthrough came later in 2013, at StarSeries VIII, where they came in as a late replacement for Clan-Mystik.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Rise To Fame</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Serbian team, who had reached an agreement with GamePub just days before the event, surpassed all expectations as they finished in third place, beating Astana Dragons and playing close series against AGAiN and Natus Vincere, with NiKo showing that he could be a force in the future as he put up a team-high 1.11 rating. The Serbian prodigy was starting to make a name for himself, but he ended up taking a break from the game in 2014 after internal issues and some disappointing results had brought his team to an end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nexa returned to action closer to the end of the year with a slightly different version of his previous team, competing in several smaller tournaments with aim face and also in the European Championship 2014 with Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina alongside players like Faruk &ldquo;⁠pita⁠&rdquo; Pita and Benjamin &ldquo;⁠BENDJI⁠&rdquo; S&ouml;derena. A few months later, he finally took up an offer to join MOUZ &ndash; whom he had previously rejected during his break from the scene over fears he wasn&rsquo;t ready to play for an international team at the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Joining G2 Esports</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>2017 was a year of change for Nexa, who left MOUZ just two months into the season but not without giving the team a proper farewell as he averaged a sensational 1.48 rating at DreamHack Masters Las Vegas, his final tournament before the switch to FaZe. Freed from the in-game leadership shackles, Nexa immediately became the team&rsquo;s star player, picking up a title in his second tournament under the North American organization, StarSeries Season 3, where he was also the MVP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With reports of an impending move by Nexa to G2 already in full swing, FaZe enjoyed a sudden and unexpected burst of form in IEM New York, which they won convincingly after sweeping Vitality and OG in the playoffs. Nexa, who was top of the scoreboard in the three-map final (1.24 rating and 85.5 ADR), added to his MVP collection after putting up some year-high numbers, including a 1.28 rating, a 1.38 Impact rating, and 74.9% KAST.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Initial Days With G2 Esports</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Nexa slotted into <a href=\"/wiki/g2-epsorts/\">G2 </a>seamlessly, but the team was unable to contend for titles in their first months with the Serbian player. He hit the ground running with a 1.24 rating as G2 topped a very tricky BLAST Premier Fall Series group that also included FURIA, MIBR, and Astralis, and played a key role in the team&rsquo;s semi-final run in IEM Beijing-Haidian, in which he earned his final EVP award of the year with some respectable numbers, including a 1.36 Impact rating and a year-high 90.5 ADR.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After sitting out the IEM tournament, Fran&ccedil;ois &ldquo;⁠AmaNEk⁠&rdquo; Delaunay returned to the lineup for the final two events of the year, in which G2 looked somewhat sluggish, finishing 9th-12th in DreamHack Masters Winter and 5th-6th in the BLAST Premier Fall Finals.

After two days of qualifiers, it all came down to this: the top players competing in eight games in a row, with the player amassing the most points at the end awarded the championship. While MrSavage led all players in the final in terms of eliminations, his overall total was 10 points behind another of the world&acirc;&euro;&trade;s best Fortnite players, Timothy &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Bizzle&acirc;&euro; Miller.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a top-two placement in his sights, MrSavage could have played it safe. If he played with caution and didn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t overstep, racking up points for a high placement before being eliminated in the battle royale format, the silver medal would have been his.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That didn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t fit the plans of the player recently signed by the 100 Thieves organization. Instead of easing into a top finish, MrSavage decided to put on one of the greatest single-game performances in professional Fortnite history, accumulating nine eliminations en route to a Victory Royale and a $30,000 prize.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;I think that game is going to be my favorite of all time,&acirc;&euro; MrSavage told ESPN following his tournament victory, a newly-shined gold medal around his neck. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;When it was top five [in the final game] and there were four other people left, I raised my hands off my keyboard and mouse. I [said], &acirc;&euro;&tilde;I got this, bro. I think I just won.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&acirc;&euro; While teenagers winning gobs of cash isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t new in Fortnite &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; most notably 17-year-old Kyle &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Bugha&acirc;&euro; Giersdorf winning $3 million at the game&acirc;&euro;&trade;s World Cup in 2019 &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; MrSavage is different from his peers. Although boasting over 2 million followers on Instagram and Twitter at such a young age, the 100 Thieves player is taking everything in stride. Where other teenagers are jumping around the convention center halls, MrSavage carries himself far beyond his age, with some people in attendance at DreamHack shocked to hear that he doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t turn 16 until November.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When asked about how he deals with fame, the young phenom can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t quite explain it. The only thing he can think of is that it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s &acirc;&euro;&oelig;natural,&acirc;&euro; as if everything that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s happening to him was meant to happen this way. His mother, back home in Norway, woke up in the middle of the night on Sunday morning to watch him qualify for the final. His father, who travels with his son to various Fortnite events around the world, had the best seat in the house to watch his son have the biggest moment of his young career.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s the norm when discussing parents and esports that the idea of their teenage child globetrotting playing a video game would cause strife, but not with MrSavage and his parents. With all of their children, they want them to achieve the goals set out for themselves. On Sunday in Anaheim, the elder Andersen got to see that come to fruition firsthand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Fortnite, there are many high-variance players, generally from the slew of teenage prodigies making their way up the ranks online or on the console. They&acirc;&euro;&trade;re the ones that are looking for eliminations from the instant they drop onto a map, falling back on their mechanics and outplay ability to carry them to victories. These are the type of players that generally will have amazing one-off performances but often find themselves falling out of tournaments due to the unpredictability of Fortnite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are also &acirc;&euro;&oelig;placement players&acirc;&euro;, who are the opposite of those high-variance aggressors. They don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t score a lot of eliminations or have the flashiest showings and are unlikely to ever win a world championship, but they&acirc;&euro;&trade;re smart. They know how to navigate the minefield that is the randomness of Fortnite and make money from it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To Bugha, who was co-streaming the event on his Twitch channel, what makes MrSavage such incredible talent is that he is a combination of both those archetypes. He&acirc;&euro;&trade;s intelligent enough not to go all-in on every single map, hoping that his mechanics can bring him to the winner&acirc;&euro;&trade;s circle. But he also has those mechanics when they need to be called upon, like in his fateful finale in Anaheim, where his killer instinct won him the title with all the chips on the table.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, what&acirc;&euro;&trade;s next for arguably the world&acirc;&euro;&trade;s best player? A promise of a World Cup championship?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the responsibility given to him by his parents, he&acirc;&euro;&trade;s takes everything in stride. No declarations of champions. No trash talk. All he wants is for Epic Games to announce their next big tournament, so he can show up and do what he does best.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;Epic Games haven&acirc;&euro;&trade;t announced anything,&acirc;&euro; MrSavage said. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;I hope I can keep up my good placings and hopefully win the next one as well.&acirc;&euro;</p>", "ref": "", "page_type": 2, "writer": null, "tags": [16, 73, 67, 63]}}, {"model": "core.wiki", "pk": 100, "fields": {"title": "Benjyfishy", "slug": "benjyfishy", "avatar": 892, "created_at": "2022-04-09T13:46:12.712Z", "updated_at": "2022-05-02T14:03:12.640Z", "meta_title": "Benjyfishy", "meta_description": "<p>Benjyfishy</p>", "canonical_url": null, "index_page": true, "publish": true, "meta_images": null, "info_box": 349, "overview": "<p>Benjy David Fish also known as Benjyfishy is an English Fortnite professional player for NRG Esports.

He is commonly known for playing with his partner Tfue regularly and in tournaments. He won the Fall Skirmish Tournament with Turner (Tfue) in October 2018. On March 3, 2018, alongside Jaomock, 72hrs, and SpaceLyon, Dennis became a member of FaZe Clan and was chosen as captain of the FaZe Fortnite roster. Due to unfortunate circumstances that Dennis has stated also happened to Turner, Dennis announced in June 2019 that he was departing from FaZe, at that moment no longer associating himself with the group. This happened weeks after Turner&rsquo;s departure from FaZe, the only difference being that Dennis still had good words to say about FaZe. He is 24 years old and was born on December 26, 1995.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Cloak History</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Dennis started his career playing H1Z1 professionally. During the PUBG genre, he was a member of team &lsquo;KnightsGG.&rsquo; On January 24, 2018, Dennis once created a World Record for most eliminations in a single game of Fortnite, having 34 eliminations. He started gaining more growth since the World Record and became a member of FaZe one month later.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Cloak Controversy</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Outburst with Tfue</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Dennis and his friends Tfue and 72hrs have been Fortnite competitive trio partners several times. Three of them placed 11th in the first week of the trio champion series, and 5th place in the 2nd week. The outburst started with Tfue asking for another trio, Dennis tweeting about doing an advertisement, and 72hrs asking for trio partners as well. Tfue then turned his stream on several minutes later. And around the beginning of the stream, Dennis was spamming Tfue in the chat stating &ldquo;If you want to play we have to cut an hour short for this one and start an hour late for the next @Tfue&rdquo;, meaning they are going to play the next trio champion series an hour late. Tfue made the response stating that Dennis and 72hrs have not been playing Fortnite as much as they used to, such as playing World of Warcraft Classic and taking a break from Fortnite. However, Tfue thought they were still going to play the trio champion series. Tfue was also offered by Madden to play their game for $140,000. Tfue declined the offer because he thought he was still going to play with his trio Dennis and 72hrs. Tfue later said he was not upset, but Dennis and 72hrs did not tell Tfue about the deal when they were playing Madden for a brand deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Cloak Response</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When Dennis was doing a viewing party, he responded about Tfue declining the brand deal, stating that Tfue made a dumb decision to decline the brand deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When 72hrs was playing World of Warcraft Classic, he responded about himself and Dennis accepting the brand deal with Madden and later on asked Tfue about it so they could be a trio in the game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dennis&rsquo;s Fortnite username was &lsquo;FaZe Cloak&rsquo;, but wanted to change the name to &lsquo;Cloakzy&rsquo; (since the name was already taken, and was possibly thinking of departing from FaZe at this time). Dennis told Epic Games via Email to get the name but had to pay $20,000 (according to Dennis). Since Dennis refused, his name was instead changed to &lsquo;Crazy&rsquo;.</p>", "ref": "", "page_type": 2, "writer": null, "tags": [16, 66, 67, 71]}}, {"model": "core.wiki", "pk": 103, "fields": {"title": "Fresh", "slug": "fresh", "avatar": 898, "created_at": "2022-04-09T13:48:59.005Z", "updated_at": "2022-05-02T13:47:26.551Z", "meta_title": "Fresh", "meta_description": "<p>Fresh</p>", "canonical_url": null, "index_page": true, "publish": true, "meta_images": null, "info_box": 352, "overview": "<p>Harley Fresh better known online as Fresh is an Australian YouTuber, Twitch streamer, and a competitive Fortnite: Battle Royale player.

Yip even recalls his mother saying he was going to be a failure since she lacked an understanding of the professional gaming scene. Her disdain for gaming made Yip feel that his mother had failed him and ultimately drove him out of his own home. Yip picked up and flew to LA to pursue his interests in gaming. Yip stopped playing Counter-Strike 1.6 for a time in favor of other games such as RuneScape, MapleStory, League of Legends, and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. He eventually picked up Counter-Strike 1.6 again, but would only play surf maps and mods. Yip began playing Counter-Strike: Global Offensive in the summer of 2014 after a friend gifted him a copy.

He signed the Cloud9 contract a few hours after his 18th birthday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His addition was met with criticism from some veteran players.

gaming organization established in the Netherlands in 2000. With a strong focus on Dota 2, StarCraft 2, and League of Legends, the team has earned a reputation as one of the most successful and consistent teams in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To date, Team Liquid has won over 200 tournaments and championships, including three Dota 2 International Championships and two League of Legends World Championships. In addition to its competitive success, the team is also known for its strong community and support of up-and-coming players and teams.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Controversies</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the biggest controversies surrounding Team Liquid is their decision to replace Chae &quot;Piglet&quot; Gwang-jin with Kim &quot;Violet&quot; Dong-hwi. Piglet is a fan favorite and was seen as one of the best players on the team. Many fans were upset that he was being replaced and felt that it was a mistake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another controversy was their decision to drop long-time support player Jo &quot;CoreJJ&quot; Yong-in. CoreJJ was a fan favorite and had been with the team for a long time. His replacement, Kim &quot;Olleh&quot; Joo-sung, was not well known and many fans felt that he was not up to the task of replacing CoreJJ.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The final controversy surrounds the team&#39;s decision to Bootcamp in Korea. This caused a lot of strife within the team as many of the players are not comfortable living and playing in Korea. This led to some players, including Piglet, threatening to leave the team.</p>", "ref": "", "page_type": 3, "writer": null, "tags": [132, 4, 63]}}, {"model": "core.wiki", "pk": 109, "fields": {"title": "100 Thieves", "slug": "100-thieves", "avatar": 958, "created_at": "2022-04-11T11:48:32.269Z", "updated_at": "2022-05-20T12:54:17.961Z", "meta_title": "100 Thieves Wiki", "meta_description": "100 Thieves is an American esports organization founded in 2017, primarily known for its Call of Duty team.

The organization has won multiple championships in different games and has had many top finishes in other events. NRG Esports is a force to be reckoned with in the esports world.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Controversies</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>NRG Esports is a professional esports organization based in the United States. The organization was founded in 2015, and its current CEO is Andy Miller. NRG has teams competing in League of Legends, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Overwatch, Smite, and Rocket League.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The organization made headlines in October of 2019 when it was revealed that one of its Counter-Strike: Global Offensive players, Chet &quot;ImAPet&quot; Singh, had been accused of match-fixing. The accusation came from a former professional Counter-Strike player, Sam &quot;DaZeD&quot; Marine, who claimed that he had witnessed Singh engaging in match-fixing while the two were playing together on a team in 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This controversy caused NRG to lose sponsorships from Intel and HyperX, and the organization was forced to release Singh from his contract. NRG later released a statement saying that it &quot;does not condone or tolerate match-fixing&quot;, and that it would be conducting an internal investigation into the matter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The organization was again embroiled in controversy in early 2020 when it was revealed that one of its Smite players, Andin &quot;Andinster&quot; Ster, had been accused of sexual harassment by a former teammate. The allegations came to light after the #MeToo movement began to gain traction on social media, and Andinster was subsequently suspended from the team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;NRG released a statement saying that it &quot;takes all allegations of misconduct seriously&quot;, and that it was &quot;cooperating fully&quot; with an investigation being conducted by Hi-Rez Studios, the developer of the Smite game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These controversies have caused many to question NRG&#39;s commitment to its players and its ability to handle sensitive situations.

Gambit has won numerous championships and tournaments in a variety of games, such as Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Dota 2, League of Legends, and more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of Gambit&rsquo;s most notable achievements include winning the PGL Major Krak&oacute;w 2017 in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, as well as becoming the first-ever CIS team to win a Valve-sponsored Major tournament. The team has also won the Dota 2 Asia Championships 2018, defeating some of the best teams in the world in the process. In League of Legends, Gambit has won the LCL Summer Split of 2018 and 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, Gambit Esports has cemented its place as one of the premier esports organizations in the world, with a plethora of championship titles and tournament victories to its name. The team shows no signs of slowing down and will continue to compete at the highest levels of various esports scenes in the years to come.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Controversies</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Gambit Esports is one of the most successful esports teams in the world, with a strong pedigree in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS: GO). However, the team has also been embroiled in several controversies over the years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2016, Gambit was accused of match-fixing by a former player. The allegations were never proven, but the team was banned from competing in the ESL Pro League as a result.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2017, another former player accused the team of cheating at a major tournament. This time, the allegations were proven and the team was fined and given a warning by the Esports Integrity Commission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2019, the team was again accused of match-fixing, this time by a Ukrainian journalist. The journalist claimed to have evidence that Gambit had fixed a match against Natus Vincere at the StarLadder Major. However, the evidence was never made public and the team was cleared of any wrongdoing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite these controversies, Gambit has continued to be one of the top teams in CS: GO, winning multiple tournaments and becoming one of the most decorated teams in the history of the game.</p>", "ref": "", "page_type": 3, "writer": null, "tags": [20]}}, {"model": "core.wiki", "pk": 113, "fields": {"title": "Rogue", "slug": "rogue", "avatar": 962, "created_at": "2022-04-11T11:48:32.275Z", "updated_at": "2022-05-20T12:53:47.506Z", "meta_title": "Rogue Wiki", "meta_description": "Rogue is a professional esports team that was formed in May of 2016.

The team is based in the United States and has players from all over the world. Rogue has teams that compete in a variety of games, including Overwatch, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, and Rainbow Six Siege.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The organization was founded by Franklin &quot;Frank&quot; Villarreal and Ryan &quot;Ryu&quot; Wagner. The two had previous experience in the esports industry, with Wagner having worked as a journalist and Villarreal as a player and coach. The two decided to start their organization after they saw a lack of structure and professionalism in the scene.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rogue&#39;s first team was their Overwatch team, which was made up of former Luminosity Gaming players. The team quickly became one of the best in North America, winning several tournaments. In August 2016, the team made a surprise appearance at the Overwatch Open, where they made it to the semifinals before losing to the eventual winners, Lunatic-Hai.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since then, Rogue has expanded into other games and has had success in all of them. In Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, the team has won several tournaments, including the ELEAGUE Major Boston 2018. In Rainbow Six Siege, the team is one of the best in North America and has won multiple tournaments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The organization has also seen success outside of games, with their apparel and merchandise selling well. Rogue has partnerships with several companies, including Twitch, Monster Energy, and SteelSeries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rogue is one of the most successful esports organizations in the world and has a bright future ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Rogue Team Divisions and Players</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n\t<thead>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"row\">Games</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\">Team Members ID&nbsp;</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\">Team Members</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\">Role</th>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</thead>\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<th colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"5\" scope=\"row\"><img src=\"data:image/png;base64,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\" style=\"height:53px;

In 2018, the team won the ELEAGUE Major Boston again, becoming the first team ever to win two majors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The team&#39;s success in CS: GO has made them one of the most successful esports teams in the world. In 2018, the team was ranked #1 in the world by HLTV.org. The team has also won several other prestigious tournaments, such as the Intel Extreme Masters (IEM) Katowice 2019 and the StarSeries i-League Season 7.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The team&#39;s success is due to the hard work of the players and the coaching staff. The team&#39;s captain, Christopher &quot;GeT_RiGhT&quot; Alesund, is considered to be one of the best CS: GO players in the world. The team&#39;s coach, Luis &quot;peacemaker&quot; Tadeu, is also highly respected in the CS: GO community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The team&#39;s achievements have made them one of the most popular esports teams in the world.

In 2016, the team was accused of match-fixing by a former member. This led to an investigation by the Esports Integrity Coalition, which cleared the team of any wrongdoing. However, the allegations caused a rift within the team, with some members leaving as a result.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2017, Rogue was once again accused of match-fixing, this time by a professional Counter-Strike: Global Offensive player. The allegations were again found to be unsubstantiated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2018, the team was accused of using an aimbot during a match. The accusation was made by a professional player who was playing against Rogue at the time. However, the accusation was later found to be false.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rogue has also been accused of not paying its players on several occasions. In 2016, the team was accused of not paying its Counter-Strike: Global Offensive players their winnings from a tournament. The team later admitted that it had not paid the players, and said that it would do so in the future. In 2017, the team was again accused of not paying its players, this time for their work in an online league. The team blamed the league for the delay in payments and said that it would pay the players as soon as the league paid them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the controversies, Rogue has remained one of the top esports teams in the world.

In 2014, the organization&#39;s Counter-Strike: Global Offensive team won the ESL One Cologne Major, becoming the first North American team to ever win a Counter-Strike Major.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2016, Cloud9&#39;s League of Legends team qualified for the World Championship, becoming the first North American team to do so in five years. The team went on to make it to the semifinals of the tournament, eventually finishing in fourth place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2018, Cloud9&#39;s Counter-Strike: Global Offensive team won the ELEAGUE Major Boston, again becoming the first North American team to win a Counter-Strike Major.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cloud9 is one of the most successful esports organizations in the world, and its achievements are a testament to that. The organization will continue to be a force in the world of esports for years to come.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Controversies</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2016, it was revealed that one of the team&#39;s players had been using an aimbot (a program that helps a player aim more accurately) in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive competitions. The player was banned from the game and Cloud9&#39;s reputation was tarnished, with many calling for the team to be disqualified from the tournament in which it was competing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2018, the team was again in the headlines for the wrong reasons when one of its players was accused of sexual harassment by a female streamer. The player denied the allegations but was ultimately released by Cloud9.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These controversies have led to calls for greater regulation of esports teams and players, to ensure that such incidents do not occur in the future. At the same time, they have also served as a reminder of the fragility of the esports industry, which is still in its infancy and yet to establish clear rules and regulations.</p>", "body": "", "ref": "", "page_type": 3, "writer": null, "tags": []}}, {"model": "core.wiki", "pk": 119, "fields": {"title": "Ghost Gaming", "slug": "ghost-gaming", "avatar": 968, "created_at": "2022-04-11T11:48:32.283Z", "updated_at": "2022-05-23T13:52:41.693Z", "meta_title": "Ghost Gaming Wiki", "meta_description": "Ghost Gaming is an esports organization with teams in various games.

The organization currently has players competing in League of Legends, Call of Duty, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Overwatch, and Hearthstone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Giants Gaming&#39;s first venture into the competitive League of Legends scene was in early 2013 when they picked up the roster of Team Coast EU. The team&#39;s first showing was at the IEM Season VII - World Championship, where they placed 9th-12th. After a few months with the team, they qualified for the EU LCS Summer Split. The team had a relatively successful split, finishing in 5th place with a 10-8 record. However, they were unable to make it to the World Championship after being knocked out of the EU LCS Regional Qualifiers by Evil Geniuses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In late 2013, the team parted ways with their Call of Duty roster. In early 2014, they picked up a new Counter-Strike: Global Offensive team, which included future star player Adil &quot;ScreaM&quot; Benrlitom. The team had moderate success in online tournaments, but they were unable to find similar success offline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In mid-2014, the team&#39;s League of Legends roster left the organization to join H2k Gaming. Giants Gaming picked up a new roster shortly after, but they were unable to replicate the success of the previous roster and finished the EU LCS Summer Split in 9th place, resulting in them being relegated to the EU CS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The team spent the next year bouncing between the EU CS and the EU LCS, but they were unable to find consistent success. In early 2016, the team&#39;s Counter-Strike roster left to join G2 Esports. This was followed by the departures of the team&#39;s League of Legends and Call of Duty rosters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Giants Gaming went through a period of instability in 2016 and 2017, but they were able to pick up a few new rosters in 2018. The team&#39;s most successful roster currently is their League of Legends roster, which finished 3rd in the 2018 EU LCS Spring Split.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Giants Gaming Game Divisions and Players</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n\t<thead>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"row\">Game</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\">Team Members ID</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\">Team Members</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\">Role</th>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</thead>\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<th colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"5\" scope=\"row\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.gamerstats.net/media/uploads/2022/05/19/valorant_small.svg\" style=\"height:120px; width:116px\" title=\"Valorant\" /><br />\r\n\t\t\tValorant</th>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Fit1nho</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Adolfo Gallego</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>russ</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Batuhan Malga&ccedil;</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Quick</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Fabian Pereira Gomez</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Jesse</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Adam Čtvrtn&iacute;ček</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Kiles</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Vladyslav Shvets</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<th colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"5\" scope=\"row\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.gamerstats.net/media/uploads/2022/05/21/image-20220521122917-1.png\" style=\"height:120px; width:120px\" title=\"League of legends\" /><br />\r\n\t\t\tLeague of legends</th>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Th3Antonio</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Antonio Espinosa</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Top</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Maxlore</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Nubar Sarafian</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Jungle</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Jiizuke</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Daniele di Mauro</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Mid</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Keduii</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Tim Willers</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Bot</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Advienne</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Henk Reijenga</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Support</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Achievements</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Giants Gaming is a Spanish professional esports organization located in Madrid.

The organization has teams in a variety of games, including Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Overwatch, League of Legends, and more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cloud9 has seen a great deal of success in its short history. In 2014, the organization&#39;s Counter-Strike: Global Offensive team won the ESL One Cologne Major, becoming the first North American team to ever win a Counter-Strike Major.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2016, Cloud9&#39;s League of Legends team qualified for the World Championship, becoming the first North American team to do so in five years. The team went on to make it to the semifinals of the tournament, eventually finishing in fourth place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2018, Cloud9&#39;s Counter-Strike: Global Offensive team won the ELEAGUE Major Boston, again becoming the first North American team to win a Counter-Strike Major.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cloud9 is one of the most successful esports organizations in the world, and its achievements are a testament to that. The organization will continue to be a force in the world of esports for years to come.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Controversies</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2016, it was revealed that one of the team&#39;s players had been using an aimbot (a program that helps a player aim more accurately) in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive competitions. The player was banned from the game and Cloud9&#39;s reputation was tarnished, with many calling for the team to be disqualified from the tournament in which it was competing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2018, the team was again in the headlines for the wrong reasons when one of its players was accused of sexual harassment by a female streamer. The player denied the allegations but was ultimately released by Cloud9.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These controversies have led to calls for greater regulation of esports teams and players, to ensure that such incidents do not occur in the future. At the same time, they have also served as a reminder of the fragility of the esports industry, which is still in its infancy and yet to establish clear rules and regulations.</p>", "ref": "",

Within the hour, the admin team said they did not have any conclusive evidence and let Axis play in the upper bracket final.

Both teams are coming into this match with a lot of momentum, and it&#39;s sure to be a close one. FaZe Clan has been on a roll lately, winning several tournaments leading up to this event. NIP is no slouch either, they&#39;ve been consistently placing well in tournaments, and they&#39;re looking to take down FaZe Clan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From today, every match comes under a single-elimination bracket. A single match loss will entirely wipe out the team&#39;s chances of winning the biggest CS:GO tournament.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stats wise, both teams are somewhat similar. However, NIP is at #7 in World&#39;s ranking and FaZe Clan, on the other hand, is #1. FaZe has been maintaining its number one ranking for quite a while. The Ukrainian team Natus Vincere did take the number one spot, but in the BLAST Premier event, FaZe regained its number one position in the World&#39;s ranking.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>FaZe Clan VS NIP Player Roster Stats&nbsp;</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If we look into the statistics of each player between both teams, overall, FaZe seems to be stronger than NIP&#39;s roster players.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both players are rifles if we compare REZ from NIP and rain from FaZe.
